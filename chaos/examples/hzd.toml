# == Remap Modifiers ==
#
# Remap modifiers swap controller signals. Unlike other types of modifiers, these operate on the
# signal names (L1, RX, etc.) rather than the defined commands.
#
# In addition to the general parameters required for all modules, the following parameters are
# defined:
#
# remap: an array of inline tables defining the remapping. The following keys are defined:
#   - from: The signal as received from the controller
#   - to: The signal that will be sent to the console in place of the 'from' signal. If an
#     axis is being mapped to a button, positive axis signals are mapped to this button.
#   - to_neg: When an axis is mapped to a button, negative axis values are sent to this signal.
#   - to_min: Boolean. If true, the 'to' signal will be set to the minimum value when mapping
#     a button to an axis. If false, the 'to' signal will be set to the maximum value.
#   - threshold: Proportion of maximum axis signal before sending the signal to a button.
#   - invert: Boolean. If true, the sign of the signal is flipped (e.g., -1 becomes 1, etc.)
#   - sensitivity: A scaling factor. The from signal is divided by this factor during remapping

# === Menu Modifiers ===
#
# Menu modifiers select an item in the game menu and (if applicable) set it to a particular
# value for the lifetime of the modifier. When the modifier is removed, the value is restored
# to its previous state.
#
# In addition to the general parameters required for all modules, the following parameters are
# defined:
#
# item:  The menu item to be selected. This must be the name of an item/submenu defined in the menu
#        layout.
# value: An integer indicating the value to set the menu item to. Items that are "select" types do
#        not require a value.
