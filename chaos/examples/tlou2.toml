# Command Mapping
#
# This section defines the commands that this game supports, or at least the ones that we can
# intercept and modify. If you have remapped the game controls from their default settings, you
# should edit this section to reflect the values that the game expects to receive. Note that
# if you change the command mappings in-game while the chaos engine is running, you must both edit
# this file and restart the engine so it can re-read the updated file.
#
# There are three parts to each command definition: 
#
# name: The label used to refer to the action in the elsewhere in this configuration file.
#
# binding: The controller event (button, axis, etc.) attached to this command. The following names
# are defined for the control bindings. Note that these cannot be changed in this file:
#
#          Main Buttons: X, CIRCLE, TRIANGLE, SQUARE
#          Bumper buttons: L1, R1
#          Hybrid button/axis: L2, R2
#          Other buttons: SHARE, OPTIONS, PS
#          Joystick buttons: L3, R3
#          Left joystick: LX, LY
#          Right joystick: RX, RY
#          D-pad: DX, DY
#          Touchpad buttons: TOUCHPAD, TOUCHPAD_ACTIVE, TOUCHPAD_ACTIVE_2
#          Touchpad axes: TOUCHPAD_X, TOUCHPAD_Y, TOUCHPAD_X_2, TOUCHPAD_Y_2
#          Accelerometer: ACCX, ACCY, ACCZ
#          Gyroscope: GYRX, GYRY, GYRZ
#         
# condition: A particular game state that must be true for the specific controller event to have
# the assigned meaning. For example, a particular command may apply only when aiming a weapon. The
# conditional is optional, but if used must be the name of a condition defined below.
# 
# Note that command names must be unique, but you can define multiple names to point to the same
# signal. This allows for aliases, in case you want to use different command names in different

# Game Conditions
#
# Tests the state of the game for particular conditions. Conditions can be transient, reflecting
# the real-time state of the controller, or persistent. Persistent conditions remember previous
# controller actions, such as selecting a weapon, that may not be reflected in the current state of
# the controller. Because conditions are defined in terms of game commands rather the raw buttons,
# conditions account for remapping of inputs performed by some mods.
#
# The following keys are defined:
# - name: The name by which the condition is identified in the TOML file. (Required)
# - persistent: Boolean value to indicate whether the condition's state persists after being
# triggered. (Optional, default = false)
# - trueOn: An array of commands that will be tested to determine if the condition is true. The
# commands must be in an array even if there is only one command. Persistent commands set a game
# state to true when this command state transitions from false to true. Non-persistent commands
# test the current state of the controller for this command. (Required)
# - trueOff: For persistent conditions, an array of commands that will be tested to determine
# when the condition is reset to false. (Optional)
# - threshold: The proportion of the maximum value for the particular command being tested.
# The legal range of values is $0 \le x \le 1$. The sign of the incoming signal is accounted for
# in the test type. Note that a threshold is really only relevant for signals that are different
# types of axes. The states of the pure buttons are only 0 or 1.
# - thresholdType: Defines the test applied to the threshold. The following tests are available:
#     - greater: A positive signal greater than the threshold triggers the signal. The shortcut ">"
#       can also be used for this type.
#     - greater_equal: A positive signal greater than or equal to the threshold triggers the signal.
#     - less: A negative signal less than the threshold triggers the signal. The shortcut "<" can
#       also be used for this type.
#     - less_equal: A negative signal less than or equal to the threshold triggers the signal. The
#       shortcut "<=" can also be used for this type.
#     - magnitude: A signal that is greater than the absolute value of the signal triggers the
#       signal. (Default)
#     - distance: Calculates the Pythagorean distance of the first two signals in the condition
#       list (this assumes that they are axes). The condition is true if this distance exceeds the
#       threshold.
# - testType: For a thresholdType other than DISTANCE, the logical relationship required for the
# individual conditions. The possible values are:
#     - ALL: All commands in the array must be past the threshold simultaneously. (Default)
#     - ANY: One or more of the commands in the array must be past the threshold.
#     - NONE: Note of the commands in the array must be past the threshold.
# 
# Notes:
# The default threshold and thresholdType settings have the effect of returning a true condition
# on any non-zero signal from the specified game commands.
#
# The commands used in conditions must be those defined without conditions of their own. This
# requirement is both for speed of processing the conditions and to avoid the possibility of
# infinite recursion.

# can simplify your task be defining that sequence once here and referencing it in the mod
# definitions. These sequences are also used to define certain game commands (e.g., involving menu

# === Menu Layout ===
#
# A menu is defined as a series of inline tables, each of which describes a single menu item.
# By defining the complete menu system (or at least that portion which the engine needs to know
# about for the modifiers), menu modifiers can simply reference the menu option they want to
# invoke and the engine will calculate the complete series of button presses necessary to get to
# it automatically.
# 
# A menu item has the following parameters defined:
# name:   A unique name for this menu item (Required)
# type:   The category of menu item (Required). The available types are:
#         + option: Item is an option. Options are set to integer values representing their
#           possible states, e.g., a boolean flag would be 0 = off, 1 = on. 0 always reflects the
#           minimum value. The maximum value will be item dependent.
#         + select: Item executes some command (e.g., restart encounter) that does not have an
#           option value associated with it.
#         + menu: Item is an ordinary menu that appears in a standard list. Selecting it will
#           go to that sub menu.
#         
# parent:   The parent menu for this item. If omitted, this item belongs to the root (main)
#           menu. (Optional)
# offset:   The number of actions required to reach this item from the first item in the list. Must
#           be an integer. Positive values navigate down, negative values navigate up. If the menu
#           contains items that are hidden by default, the offsets should reflect the number of
#           actions required to reach the option with the items in their default state. This means
#           that a default-hidden entry will share an offset with a default-unhidden one. When the
#           hidden entry is revealed, the offset will be recalculated. See the main menu below for
#           an example. (Required)
# - tab:    An integer indicating a group of items within a parent menu. Items in this group are
#           displayed together and you must navigate from tab to tab with a different command from
#           the normal menu up/down items. The value of the integer indicates the number of tab
#           button presses required to reach this group from the default tab. Positive values mean
#           tab right, negative values mean tab left. (Optional)
# - hidden: A boolean value which if true indicates that the menu item is not displayed in the
#           list currently. Menu items can be hidden or revealed as a result of other actions in
#           the game. The default value is false. (Optional)
# - confirm: For options/select items, selecting this option requires a yes/no confirmation.
# - initialState: For options, the starting value for the menu item, expressed as an integer
#           indicating the number of button presses away from the minimum value required to reach
#           this state.
# - counter: Name of a menu option whose counter is to be incremented when this menu option is set
#            and decremented when this option is restored.
# - counterAction: Action to take after this menu option's counter changes. The currently supported
#            values are:
#            + reveal: Menu option is shown when the counter is non-zero, hidden when zero
# - guard:   Reference to another item in the same list that acts as a "guard" for this item. The
#            referenced option must be enabled before we can set this value.
#
# Parent menu items must be declared before the child items that reference those parents, but the
# definition order is otherwise unconstrained.
#
# For illustration, TLOU2 menu options that are unused are listed below and commented out. In
# practice, you only need to define the menu items that the engine will actually invoke.

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Gameplay Modifiers
#
# A modifier is a specific alteration of a game's operation, for example disabling a particular
# control, or inverting the direction of a joystick movement. Specific types of modifiers are
# available to implement specific kinds of actions.
#
# Each modifier is defined in its own table, labeled [[modifier]]. Regardless of type, each
# modifier must specify values for the following keys:
#
# - name: A unique string identifying this mod (Required). This is the name by which the mod is
#         selected, for example, when a user asks the chatbot to define its functionality, as well
#         as the name shown in the voting and in-effect overlays.
# - description: An explanatation of the mod for use by the chat bot (Required)
# - type: The class of modifier (Required).
#
# The following modifier classes are currently implemented:
# - cooldown: Allow a command for a set time then force a recharge period before it can be used again.
# - delay: Wait for a set amount of time before sending a command.
# - disable: Block commands from being sent to the console.
# - formula: Alter the magnitude and/or offset of the signal through a formula
# - invert: Invert the sign of the signal.
# - menu: Apply a setting from the game's menus.
# - parent: A mod that contains other mods as children.
# - remap: Change which controls issue which commands.
# - repeat: Repeat a particular command at intervals.
# - sequence: Issue an arbitrary sequence of actions.
#
# - group: A classification of that can be used by the chat bot for voting (e.g., to ensure that)
#       only one mod in a category can be voted on at the same time. If omitted, the mod is
#       assigned to the default "general" group. (Optional)
# 
# In this file, modifiers are sorted by type, and documentation for each type appears above the
# first one. In most cases, however, modifiers can usually be defined in any order you prefer.
# The one exception is for modifiers of the parent type that reference specific, named modifiers
# as children. In this case, the child modifiers must be defined earlier in this file than the
# parent.
#
# == Disable Modifiers ==
# Modifiers of this type block commands from being passed to the controller, either unconditionally
# or under various conditions. In addition to the keys required for all modifiers, the following
# keys are defined:
# - appliesTo: The command or commands affected by the mod. The commands must be in square brackets
#     even if there is only one. (Required)
#
# - filter: Which values to block (Optional). The value must be one of the following:
#       + all: block all non-zero values (Default if omitted)
#       + below: Values less than the threshold are blocked. Those above it are passed through
#       + above: Values  block all values above the threshold
#
# - threshold: The threshold state above or below which signals will be filtered. (Optional)
#   The default if omitted is 0. If more than one command is in the appliesTo list, all commands
#   are subject to the same filter threshold.
#
# - condition: An array of conditions whose total evaluation must be true for filtering to take
# place. Conditions are separate from the filter threshold test that is performed on the appliesTo
# commands, and they must be one or more of those defined above. (Optional)
#
# - unless: An array of conditions whose total evaluation must be false for filtering to take
# place. The test of listed commands functions exactly as 'condition', but the commands are
# disabled only if test of the conditions returns false.
#
# Both condition and unless can be defined simultaneously for separate commands, if some sates
# must be true and others false. In this case, for signal filtering to occur, 
#
# - conditionTest: Type of test to perform when more than one game condition is in the array.
# - unlessTest: Type of test to perform when more than one condition is in the unless array.
#
# Both conditionTest and unlessTest accept the following values:
#       + all: All conditions must be true (for condition) or false (for unless) simultaneously
#       + any: Any one condition must be true (for condition) or false (for unless) at one time
#       + none: None of the defined conditions must be true (for condition) or false (for unless)
#
# - sequenceBegin:  A sequence of commands to issue when the mod is activated.
# - sequenceFinish: A sequence of commands to issue when the mod is deactivated.
#
# The format for sequences is described with the sequence modifiers below.

# == Remap Modifiers ==
#
# Remap modifiers swap controller signals. Unlike other types of modifiers, these operate on the
# signal names (L1, RX, etc.) rather than the defined commands.
#
# In addition to the general parameters required for all modules, the following parameters are
# defined:
#
# remap: an array of inline tables defining the remapping. The following keys are defined:
#   - from: The signal as received from the controller
#   - to: The signal that will be sent to the console in place of the 'from' signal. If an
#     axis is being mapped to a button, positive axis signals are mapped to this button.
#   - to_neg: When an axis is mapped to a button, negative axis values are sent to this signal.
#   - to_min: Boolean. If true, the 'to' signal will be set to the minimum value when mapping
#     a button to an axis. If false, the 'to' signal will be set to the maximum value.
#   - threshold: Proportion of maximum axis signal before sending the signal to a button.
#   - invert: Boolean. If true, the sign of the signal is flipped (e.g., -1 becomes 1, etc.)
#   - sensitivity: A scaling factor. The from signal is divided by this factor during remapping
