# Command Mapping
#
# This section defines the commands that this game supports, or at least the
# ones that we can interect and modify. This mapping allows to support
# modifiers that do the right thing even when controller buttons are remapped.
# There are three parts to each command definition: 
# name -- The label used to refer to the action in the modifiers
# context -- A particular game state that must be true for the specific
# controller event to have the assigned meanings. An individual command can
# be set to a state by declaring state = TRUE. If non context is defined,
# the command applies in the default situation (independent of other button
# presses, etc.
# Note that
